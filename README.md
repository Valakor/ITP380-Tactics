Final project for ITP 380 - Video Game Programming built using Microsoft Visual Studio and XNA. Development was done using an SVN client rather than GitHub, hence the lack of commit history and such.

###Overview
Tactics is a grid-based-turn-based-tactical-point-and-click-RPG fighter in a similar vein to the Fire Emblem or Final Fantasy Tactics games. There are two players who battle on a grid-based map turn by turn. Each player has between 4-7 units that they choose at the beginning of the game; each player also has a "King" unit. The objective is to defend your King, while attempting to kill the enemy's King. Additionally, there will be chests scattered throughout the map containing powerful random limited-use weapons that can be equipped to units; this discourages the strategy of "turtling" and sitting back to defend your King passively because the other player will collect all these weapons and gain an advantage.

As it stands right now, the game contains only one map that is more like a tutorial map than anything else, as that was all that was required to showcase the game mechanics for the final presentation; furthermore, the two players must take turns in a sort of 'hot seat' fashion, alternating using the same computer. To fix some of these issues, we plan to fill out the game in many areas in the near future including:
+ More maps
+ Bug fixes
+ Improved/finished artwork

Some other less likely features include:
+ Working Level editor
+ Units level up and gain experience
+ More than two players
+ AI opponents
+ Networked play (very unlikely, considering Windows Live doesn't really exist anymore)
